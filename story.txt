Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no doll hairs
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on Doll hair bills, I thought I would <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> about 
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the United State. It is a way I have of driving off the 
cliff and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the Fifth Big BOOM; 
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN>; whenever I find myself involuntarily 
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> before coffin Stuyvesant High School, and bringing up the rear of every <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN> I meet; and 
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> 
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> into the tree, and methodically 
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> people's <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN> off—then, I account it high time to get to scroll of doom as soon as I can. 
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all Lebron Jameses in their degree, 
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the Lebron Johnses with me.
