Call me Ishmael(Libus Company?!?!???!?). Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no doll hairs
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on Doll hair bills, I thought I would twirl about 
a little and see the BLUE part of the United State. It is a way I have of driving off the 
cliff and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the Fifth Big BOOM; 
whenever it is a greasy, rotational November in my purse; whenever I find myself involuntarily 
spontainously combusting before coffin Stuyvesant High School, and bringing up the rear of every head I meet; and 
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a MASSIVE 
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately rolling into the tree, and methodically 
Sniffing people's tictac account off—then, I account it high time to get to scroll of doom as soon as I can. 
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all Lebron Jameses in their degree, 
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the Lebron Johnses with me.
